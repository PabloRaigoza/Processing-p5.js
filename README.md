# Processing-p5.js
Here is the place where all of my Processing and p5.js code will live! All projects have been translated as well.

You may find that some of the p5.js files are slightly tweaked in the sense that they have different mechanics.
This is down on purpose as I would like for them to run on the webpage smoothly. I also may have saw potential ways where I could make the
programs better so I also may have only tweaked one.

I translate from Processing to p5.js. Finally I have assumed that you have downloaded the p5.js librairies need for the project.
I do not have the libraries with every file as this is a waste of storage.

Here is a link to download the p5.js libraires.
